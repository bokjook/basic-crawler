Intented:   basic stock blog site crawler looking/counting for like, dis-like, good/bad terms for swing trades opp. If the number of blogs increase, this maybe a sign to trade either way.

I am using beautifulsoup instead of Python's scrapy to scrape the blog site. This project still needs some works.
